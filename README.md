# DDG_Image_Get
A tool for downloading image sets from Duckduckgo.  

To Use  

Download ddg_image_get.py and user_agents.txt into the same directory. To run:  
```
./ddg_image_get.py <topic>
```
where `<topic>` is the type of images you want. If the topic is more than one word, put the terms in quotation marks, like:  
```
./ddg_image_get.py 'hot air balloon'
```

You may find it useful to actually use your browser and search Duckduckgo for the type of image you're looking for, then use this tool to quickly grab as many as you want/need.
